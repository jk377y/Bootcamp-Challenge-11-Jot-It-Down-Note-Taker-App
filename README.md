# JOT IT DOWN NOTE TAKER APP
Your challenge is to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.
<br>
## Description
This is a note taking app that can accept inputs inside the web browser and store them to be recalled at a later time from the db.json file.  There is also functionality added to delete these notes.
